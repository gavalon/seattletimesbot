seattletimesbot
===============
This is the code for a bot that scrapes articles from the Local section of The Seattle Times, 
gets the google cached versions of the articles, and posts them to a subreddit. The idea was to find a
way around the paywall. It worked nicely, though I was simply running it out of idle. I retired the bot.
